# Module 4: Pytest and Sphinx

## Overview
This module turns the GradCafe Analyzer into a tested, documented, CI-backed service. It involves (1) building a Pytest suite for the Flask web and ETL/DB layers, (2) achieving 100% coverage, and (3) publishing developer docs with Sphinx on Read the Docs. The goal is a stable, extensible system that other developers can run, test, and extend.
