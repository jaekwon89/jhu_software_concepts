Module Info: JHU EP 605.256 Module 1


Approach:
1. Based on the reference from the required reading, I created a run.py module to initialize the Flask.
  - Homepage
  - Projects
  - Contact
  - Navigation bar
    - Header
    - Top/right corner
    - Highlight the current tab
    - Colored (different from the current page)
  - Port: 8080
  - Local host: 0.0.0.0
2. Created corresponding HTML using LLM to support each route in run.py and saved them in the templates folder:
  - index.html: Homepage
  - projects.html: Projects page
  - contact.html: Contact page
  - layout.html: Base layout - header, navigation bar, and shared styles
3. Added style.css to meet the assignment requirement and my style.
4. Regularly committed changes and pushed updates to GitHub.
